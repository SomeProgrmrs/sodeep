# Sodeep Linux
## What is Sodeep Linux
Sodeep is a RancherOS fork. It is, too, a lightweight OS for servers, or RICE enthusiast. I encourage you to fork THIS of fork RancherOS for a beter experience with customizing!
## I am a Linux newb. Should I use this?
Probably not. This is a distro desgined for people like me with lots of experience. It isn't like installing, with Arch or Gentoo. It is just, hard. In general, it's hard. Compact it may be pub it is just plain hard.

## Should I use Sodeep?
Should you? Probably not. We have a small community, if not a non-existant one. It is fine for enthusiasts with VM's, I guess. But it isn't something that is popular. If it is, sure. We would enjoy support from experienced people willing for a small installation just lookin' for a nice time.
## Is this safe?
Only if you make it to be. Just follow common internet ettiqute and you won't be a target, nor get viruses. Have a secure internet, only download safe things, and you should be fine. Not like there are many viruses at us, let alone Linux in general.
